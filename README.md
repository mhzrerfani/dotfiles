# This is Awesome

I don't feel like taking screenshots right now and it's kind of a mess and don't
expect anyone to download it so who cares. Just run `yay -S lua-pam-git` and may
the lord save you.

There are commands you might want to run in `install.sh`, I haven't tested the
script so please just read the lines and run them as you understand them.
